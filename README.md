# What-are-the-modern-treatments-available-for-kidney-stones-in-India-

Kidney stones can feel like being stabbed from the inside. Many people donâ€™t even know they have one until the pain suddenly hits. But donâ€™t worry â€“ today, there are advanced and less painful treatments available in India.

Gone are the days when every stone needed open surgery. Now, we have laser lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and shock wave therapy (ESWL) that can break stones without big cuts.

At multispeciality hospitals like Care and Cure, urologists first check stone size and position using ultrasound or CT. If itâ€™s small, medicines and hydration may be enough. But if itâ€™s large or stuck, they go for laser treatment which breaks the stone into tiny pieces and removes it via urine.

These treatments are painless, daycare-based, and safer. Recovery is fast too. They also guide on diet and prevention, so stones donâ€™t come back.
